# uppy

A work in progress - nothing to see here.

## Design Goals
 
 - Support for IE10+?? (decide what our entry level IE is, it's okay to have a cut-off if that results in a more focused higher quality codebase. older browsers will need to opt for our jquery-sdk)
 - Lightweight / easy on dependencies
 - tus.io enabled
 - ES6
 - Robust (retries / resumes for *all the things*), avoid showing 'weird errors'
 - Themable UI with a beautiful default
 - Compatible with React (Native)
 - Works great on mobile
 - Small core, modular plugin architecture for everything: (modal / dragdrop / themes/ webcam / google drive / dropbox / etc)
 - Offering sugared shortcuts for novice users (presets)

## Uppy Development

First clone and install the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:transloadit/uppy.git
cd uppy
npm install
```

Now to get a sandbox environment set up, type:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will `npm run build` the project into `./build`, and then serve that
directory using a simple static http server.

## Website Development

We keep the [uppyjs.io](http://uppyjs.io) website in `./website` for so it's easy to keep docs & code in sync as we're still iterating at high velocity. For those reading this and screaming murder, [HashiCorp does this](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/website) for all their projects, and it working well for them on a scale vastly more impressive than ours.

The site is built with [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), and Travis automatically deploys this onto GitHub Pages (it overwrites the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/gh-pages) branch at every deploy).

Content is written in Markdown and located in `./website/src`. Pull requests welcome!
  
> The website is currently a clone of Yuxi Evan You's [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) website ([view license](website/LICENSE)) - just so we can hit the ground rolling in terms of setting up Haxo etc. Obviously as soon as possible, we should start rolling out our own layout & content.

`./website/update.js` is called during website builds to inject the Uppy versions & filesizes into the documentation.

It's recommended to exclude `./website/public/` from your editor if you want efficient searches.

For local previews on `http://127.0.0.1:4000` type:

```bash
make website-preview
```

## FAQ

### What does Travis do?

Travis should:

- [x] check out code 
- [x] build project
- [ ] run unit tests
- [ ] run acceptance tests
- [x] copy/install the built project into any `examples/*/`
- [x] deploy the examples to our hackathon S3 bucket in a folder named by branch (http://hackathon.transloadit.com/uppy/master/index.html), so we can all play with the current state of the project & examples per branch, without installing everything locally.
