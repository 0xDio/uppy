A work in progress - you'll find nothing useful here yet.

But if you're here to dig in, these are some places you might find interesting:

 - Our website (under construction) [http://uppyjs.io/](http://uppyjs.io/)
 - Architecture in [`website/src/api/architecture.md`](website/src/api/architecture.md)
 - Contributor's guide in [`website/src/guide/contributing.md`](website/src/guide/contributing.md)
 - [Open issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/milestones/Minimum%20Viable%20Product) before having a Minimum Valuable Product.
