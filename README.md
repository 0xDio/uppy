## Agenda 2015-11-16

 1. Introductions
 1. Tim does a screenshare/tour of the current jQuery SDK
 1. A round of questions
 1. Restating the limitation of the current plugin: missing features like resumable, externals integrations, webcam, drag & drop. Adding jquery dependency weight to all projects that want to use it. Marketing: We're missing out on some customers that see jquery as our main integration and turn away. 
 1. Filepicker moving into our encoding domain means we need to move into their file-picking domain - or have a very hard time competing
 1. A tour of the filepicker integration
 1. A brainstorm of how ours should look in the end
 1. Decide what is the minimum viable product
 1. Figure out what the steps are needed to get to a minimum viable product
