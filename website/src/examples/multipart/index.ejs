{% blockquote %}
Uppy recommends using tus resumable file uploads, but if you want you can also use Multipart (Form) uploads
{% endblockquote %}

To illustrate Uppy abstracts forms as a means to select a file, and not upload it, here
we showcase uploading files from 2 different forms in one go:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
<% include app.html %>
<script src="app.js"></script>

<hr />

<p id="console-wrapper">
  Console output (latest logs are at the top): <br />
</p>

<p>
  On this page we're using the following HTML snippet:
</p>
{% include_code lang:html dragdrop/app.html %}

<p>
  Along with this JavaScript:
</p>
{% include_code lang:js dragdrop/app.es6 %}

<p>
  And the following CSS:
</p>
{% include_code lang:css dragdrop/app.css %}
