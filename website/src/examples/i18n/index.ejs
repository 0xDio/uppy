Here you'll see a demo of how you might set Uppy to work with language packs (i18n).
Actually, two examples: pre-built bundle version ready to use with a &lt;script&gt; tag
and the module, that you can bundle yourself with tools like Webpack, Browserify or Rollup.
{% endblockquote %}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
<% include app.html %>
<script src="app.js"></script>

<hr />

<p id="console-wrapper">
  Console output (latest logs are at the top): <br />
</p>

<p>
  To load the pre-build bundle from a CDN we're using the following HTML and JavaScript:
</p>
{% include_code lang:html i18n/app.html %}

<p>
  Or, if we want this as module that we can bundle ourselves, this JavaScript:
</p>
{% include_code lang:js i18n/app.es6 %}

<p>
  And the following CSS:
</p>
{% include_code lang:css dragdrop/app.css %}
