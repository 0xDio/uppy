## Why does your site look like vuejs.org?

The website is currently a clone of Yuxi Evan You's wonderful [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) website ([view license](website/VUEORG_LICENSE)) - just so we can hit the ground running in terms of Haxo boilerplate, etc. Obviously as soon as possible, we'll start rolling out our own layout & content and make this place our own. We'll keep the Vue website MIT license & credit in the footer in tact of course.
