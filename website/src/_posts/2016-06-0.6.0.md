We are happy to announce that we have just released Uppy 0.6.0. Even though it was mainly a refactor release, we have nonetheless also managed to teach Uppy a few neat and important new tricks, and we are quite proud of that.

We are still working hard on getting Uppy ready to meet the world as soon as possible. In light of our recent promise of keeping you updated on our development progress, we would like to go over the most important changes with you.

## File Previews and Remote File Handling

* We have made a few changes that will help to improve visual clarity: Uppy now shows previews for images, and specific file icons for other types of files. 
* It is now also possible to select remote files in Uppy. Simply double-click a file from, for instance, Google Drive, and Uppy will then show it in a preview area. Good boy, Uppy!

## Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats

* We have been doing some more work on accessibility: from now on, when you switch tabs in Modal, it will focus on the first input in that tab.
* Everybody likes to see stats. That is why, on our website, you can now [view stats]((http://uppy.io/stats)) that show how acceptance tests are performing in various browsers. If a test is successful, that means Uppy will likely be able to load and upload files in that particular browser.
