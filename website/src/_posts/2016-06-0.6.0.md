> Hi! We released Uppy 0.6.0. It was mainly a refactor release, but nonetheless important, so we are proud.

we worked hard yadda yadda <insert dog joke here> :+1:. We'd like to go over the most important changes:

<!-- more -->

## File Previews and Remote File Handling

* Uppy now shows preview images for, well, images, and a file icon for other types of files
* “Remote files” can now be selected in Uppy. Meaning, you can double click on a file from Google Drive and it will be shown by Uppy in a preview area and everything. Wicked :ghost:

## Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats

* More accessibility work: when you switch tabs in Modal, it focuses on the first input in that tab
* On our website you can now [see stats]((http://uppy.io/stats)) on how acceptance tests are doing in each browser. If tests pass that generally means that Uppy can succesfully load and upload a file in that particular browser. Pretty neat!

And here's the full list of things that changed in this relase

- build: minification of the bundle (@arturi)
- build: revisit sourcemaps for production. can we have them without a mandatory extra request?
- build: supply Uppy es5 and es6 entry points in npm package (@arturi)
- build: switch to https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all instead of parallelshell (@arturi)
- drive: Make sure uppy-server does not explode on special file types: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/d4dbxitjt8clo50/2016-05-06%20at%2022.41.png (@hedgerh)
- modal: accessibility. focus on the first input field / button in tab panel (@arturi)
- progressdrawer: figure out crazy rerendering of previews by yoyo/bel: https://github.com/shama/bel/issues/26, https://github.com/shama/bel/issues/27 (@arturi)
- core: substantial refactor of mount & rendering (@arturi)
- core: better state change logs for better debugging (@arturi)
- progressdrawer: improve styles, add preview icons for all (@arturi)
- server: Start implementing the `SERVER-PLAN.md`, remote files should be added to `state.files` and marked as `remote` (@hedgerh)
- test: Add pass/fail Saucelabs flag to acceptance tests (@arturi)
- website: Polish Saucelabs stats (social badge + stats layout) (@arturi)
