Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Items can be optionally be tagged tagged by GitHub owner issue if discussion
happened / is needed.

Please add your entries in this format:

 - `- [ ] (<plugin name>|website|core|meta|build|test): <Present tense verb> <subject> \(<list of associated owners/gh-issues>\)`.

Following [SemVer spec item 4](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4),
we're `<1.0.0` and allowing ourselves to make breaking changes in minor
and patch levels.

In the current stage we aim to release a new version on the
first Monday of every new month.

## Backlog

Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point

- [ ] build: go through it together again, remove unnecessary commands, simplify (related to “clean up package.json”). Discuss how contributors might use it, add to contributing and/or readme (https://github.com/sapegin/social-likes/blob/next/Contributing.md#building-and-running-tests) (@arturi, @hedgerh, @kvz)
- [ ] build: look into using https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all instead of parallelshell
- [ ] build: minification of the bundle
- [ ] build: sourcemaps for everything (compiled es6->es5 module as well as bundle) (@arturi)
- [ ] core: Add polyfill for `fetch`
- [ ] core: Apply plugins when DOM elements aren't static (#25)
- [ ] core: consider `virtual-dom` + `main-loop` or `yo-yo` for rendering and state management
- [ ] core: Make sure Uppy works well in VR
- [ ] instagram: Add basic Instagram plugin example (#21)
- [ ] modal: Avoid duplicating event listeners
- [ ] modal: State: which tab is open? get parameters?
- [ ] presets: Add basic preset that mimics Transloadit's jQuery plugin (#28)
- [ ] test: checkout http://www.webpagetest.org, use it sometimes to test our website & Uppy?
- [ ] test: setup an HTML page with all sorts of crazy styles, resets & bootstrap to see what brakes Uppy (@arturi)
- [ ] tus: Add support tus 1.0 uploading capabilities (#3)
- [ ] website: Make cycling through taglines pretty (in terms of code and a nice animation or sth)
- [ ] website: Make a gif/video of Uppy Modal or DragDrop demo (drag & drop a few files -> upload happens)

## 0.0.5 (May 02, 2016)

- [ ] meta: Create an Uppy logo (@markstory)
- [ ] build: investigate Rollup someday, for tree-shaking and smaller dist https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1379#issuecomment-183383199, https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollupify
- [ ] core: Try to make Uppy work with React (add basic example) to remain aware of possible issues (@hedgerh), look at https://github.com/akiran/react-slick
- [ ] meta: Consider using <waffle.io> instead of Markdown task tracking. Some discussion [here](https://transloadit.slack.com/archives/general/p1455693654000062) (@hedgerh, @arturi, @tim-kos, @kvz)
- [ ] modal: polish on mobile
- [ ] website: scrollbars on code samples (can’t reproduce!) (@arturi)
- [ ] progressdrawer: let user cancel uploads in progress (@arturi)
- [ ] test: Let Travis use the Remote WebDriver instead of the Firefox WebDriver (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/#Using-Sauce-Labs), so Saucelabs can run our acceptance tests against a bunch of real browsers. Local acceptance tests keep using Firefox
