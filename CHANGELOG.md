Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Items can be optionally be tagged tagged by GitHub owner issue if discussion
happened / is needed.

Please add your entries in this format:

 - `- [ ] (<plugin name>|website|core|meta|build|test): <Present tense verb> <subject> \(<list of associated owners/gh-issues>\)`.

Following [SemVer spec item 4](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4),
we're `<1.0.0` and allowing ourselves to make breaking changes in minor

In the current stage we aim to release a new version on the
first Tuesday of every new month.

## Backlog
